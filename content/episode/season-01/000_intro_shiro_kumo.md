Hello and welcome to Shiro Kumo. Today we're introducing a podcast that takes a look at people's daily lives and the changes Corona has forced upon them. We'll be interviewing students, software engineers, artists, school teachers... to contrast what people's lives were before and now how they're dealing with the changes.
